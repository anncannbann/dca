'''
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
                                        1 2 3
                                        4 5 6
                                        9 8 9

                                        The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9 = 15, The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9 = 17, Their absolute difference is |15-17| = 2

Function Description:

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Input Format:

The first line contains a single integer, n the number of rows and columns in the square matrix arr Each of the next n lines describes a row, arr[i] and consists of n space-separated integers arr[i][j]
Output Format:

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrixâ€™s two diagonals as a single integer.
    Sample Input:
     3
     11 2 4
     4 5 6
     10 8 -12

Sample Output:

     15
